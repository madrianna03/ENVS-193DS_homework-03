Problem 1: Personal Data
a. Data summarizing
I will summarize my data by calculating the mean productivity score across categories of my grouping variables: hours of sleep the night before a study session, studying with others or not, caffeine, and location of study session. Comparing these groups will inform how each factor affects productivity levels; I expect increased caffeine and studying with others to improve my energy and attention while study locations such as my bedroom or outside to be less productive as there are more distractions. 
b. 
```{r}
#visualization: productivity across all variables
# Categorize caffeine and sleep with binning
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    caffeine_level = case_when(
      caffeine_mg == 0 ~ "None",
      caffeine_mg > 0 & caffeine_mg <= 100 ~ "Low",
      caffeine_mg > 100 & caffeine_mg <= 200 ~ "Moderate",
      caffeine_mg > 200 ~ "High"
    ),
    sleep_level = case_when(
      sleep_hrs < 6 ~ "Low",
      sleep_hrs >= 6 & sleep_hrs < 8 ~ "Medium",
      sleep_hrs >= 8 ~ "High"
    )
  )

# Pivot for grouped plots
summary_data <- data %>%
  select(productivity, with_others, sleep_level, caffeine_level, location) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(with_others, sleep_level, caffeine_level, location),
               names_to = "variable", values_to = "group") %>%
  group_by(variable, group) %>%
  summarise(mean_productivity = mean(productivity, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Bar Plot of mean productivity by with others, sleep, caffeine, and location
ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = group, y = mean_productivity, fill = variable)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Mean Productivity (1–10)", title = "Average Productivity by Group") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme_minimal()
```
c. Caption

Figure 1. Mean productivity scores (1–10) by social context, sleep level, caffeine intake, and study location. Each panel displays how productivity varies with respect to one grouping factor, helping visualize which environments or habits are linked with higher productivity.

d. Table Presentation
```{r}
library(gt)
#create productivity summary table using gt
summary_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = mean_productivity) %>% 
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Average Productivity Across Grouping Variables"
  ) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = everything(), decimals = 1)
```
Problem 2: Affective Visualization

a. I would use a set of small line charts, each showing productivity over time, but faceted by whether I was alone or with others, whether I had caffeine, the study location, sleep quality (defined by greater than 6 hours of sleep). This allows me to track how each context influenced my productivity. The effective element comes from seeing how different environments or habits affect my well-being and workflow across time, in a personal and relatable way.

c. Draft of Visualization

```{r}
df <- read.csv("~/git/ENVS-193DS_homework-03/data/ENVS193DS_personaldata_cleaned.csv") 
# Convert date to Date type
df <- df %>% mutate(date = as.Date(date))

# Convert relevant columns to character
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    with_others = as.character(with_others),
    caffeine_mg = as.character(caffeine_mg),
    sleep_hrs = as.character(sleep_hrs),
    location = as.character(location)
  )

# Reshape to long format
df_long <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(with_others, caffeine_mg, sleep_hrs, location),
    names_to = "variable",
    values_to = "value"
  )

# Optional: bin caffeine and sleep for clearer grouping
df_long <- df_long %>%
  mutate(
    value = case_when(
      variable == "caffeine_mg" ~ cut(as.numeric(value), breaks = 3, labels = c("Low", "Med", "High")),
      variable == "sleep_hrs" ~ cut(as.numeric(value), breaks = 3, labels = c("Low", "Med", "High")),
      TRUE ~ as.character(value)
    )
  )

# Plot
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = date, y = productivity, group = value, color = value)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(
    title = "How My Productivity Varies by Social Context, Caffeine, Sleep, and Study Location",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Productivity Score",
    color = "Group"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = "bold"))
#need to come back to re order
```
d. Artist Statement

My piece explores how daily factors like caffeine intake, sleep hours, study location, and social setting influence my productivity. Through a series of faceted line charts, I visualize patterns in how these variables correlate with changes in my focus and energy over time.

I was influenced by data storytelling techniques found in the work of Giorgia Lupi and the aesthetics of minimal data visualizations. Their ability to blend personal experience with visual clarity inspired me to turn routine self-tracking into a reflective and communicative work. The form of my work is a digital data visualization created using R and the ggplot2 package. It draws from principles of both statistical graphics and conceptual art to communicate. I created this piece by collecting daily data on my habits and productivity over several weeks, cleaning and reshaping the dataset, and then designing the plot to clearly represent each variable’s relationship with my performance. The use of color, faceting, and minimal design allows viewers to engage with the rhythms of my everyday life through an analytically aesthetic lens.
